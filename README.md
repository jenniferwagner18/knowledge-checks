# Simple Knowledge Checks for HTML Pages
These knowledge checks were created for instructors to use on HTML pages in their D2L courses. A sample question is provided with a code generator so new questions can be created. The included copy & paste instructions are for Brightspace by D2L, but any HTML page or LMS that supports HTML can use these knowledge checks.

Question types include multiple choice/select (which can also be used to create true/false questions), short answer/fill in the blank, matching, and ordering. They are stylized with Bootstrap 4. 

Flip Cards are keyboard accessible virtual flashcards that can be flipped on hover, click, or tab/tab+enter. Both CSS only and JavaScript versions are included.
